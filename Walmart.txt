Recommendations:
Walmart should spend more on marketing on City A and C.
Walmart should collaborate with celebrities to promote male products as we have more male buyers  and proper strategy should be deployed on increasing sale interest of female products.
Walmart have less number of long term customers(4+ years) preferably less than 14% ,it might be because of new store coming in that area .However,Some discounts/offers should be provided to retain long term customers
Though City B has high customers,still there should be some citywise campaign should be posted to boost the sales
Walmart should invest in targeted advertisements for individual buyers aged between 0-17,51-55,55+
